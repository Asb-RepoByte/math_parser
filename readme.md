# Info
this a math parser that support functions and math operation * + - / and test it
you stupid ass @moctar
# usage
- python recursive_descent.py "math expressioin"
    to evaluate the math expression
    example:
        python recursive_descent.py "(7 - -4) + sqrt(4) - pow(gdc(25, 5), 4)"
    if no math expression is given the "1 + 2" will be evaluated
- python test.py <n> 
    to test n math expression from the database n <= 1_000_000
    if <n> is ommited then the all the math expressions in the DB will be evaluated which can take time
# Requirement
basicly nothing
